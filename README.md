# binary-tree-data-structure

BinarySearchTree is a special BinaryTree where the values in left sub-tree should be less than values in right sub-tree.

BinaryTree is a tree in which each node can have at most 2 nodes.

BalancedBinaryTree is a BinaryTree where the difference in the height of left sub-tree and right sub-tree is not greater than 1.

Height of a node is maximum number of paths from that node to reach to a leaf node.

Depth of a node is the distance of that node from root node. Depth of root node is 0.
